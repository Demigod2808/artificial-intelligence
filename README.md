# Artificial Intelligence - CPSC 4383

Instructor: [ Mariofanna Milanova](http://ualr.edu/mgmilanova/index.html)

This repo contains all my work: code base, notes, exercises and solutions to accompany Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" and CPSC 4383/5383 Course.

The screenshots and images are taken from, unless specified, [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).


>AI is defined as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions.


Implementations in Java, C++, and Python of many of the algorithms discussed in the textbook are available in the authors' [online code repository](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html)
