    "- AI is a science and a set of computational technologies that are inspired by --but typically operate quite differently from -- the ways people use their nervous systems and bodies to sense, learn, reason and take action.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While drawing on common research and technologies, AI systems are specialized to accomplish particular tasks. Each application requires years of focused research and a careful, unique construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the rate of progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant advances since the field's inception 60 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Substantial increases in the future uses of AI applications, including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics and targeted treatment, and physical assistance for elder care can be expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contrary to the more fantastic predictions for AI in the popular press, the Study Panel found no cause for concern that AI is an imminent threat to humankind. No machines with self-sustaining long-term goals and intent have been developed, nor are they likely to be developed in the near future. Instead, increasingly useful applications of AI, with potentially profound positive impacts on our society and economy are likely to emerge between now and 2030."

    "\n",
    "Large-scale machine learning\n",
    "Many of the basic problems in machine learning (such as supervised and\n",
    "unsupervised learning) are well-understood. A major focus of current efforts is to\n",
    "scale existing algorithms to work with extremely large data sets. For example, whereas\n",
    "traditional methods could afford to make several passes over the data set, modern\n",
    "ones are designed to make only a single pass; in some cases, only sublinear methods\n",
    "(those that only look at a fraction of the data) can be admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep learning**, a class of learning procedures, has facilitated object recognition in images, video labeling, and activity recognition, and is making significant inroads into other areas of perception, such as audio, speech, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning** is a framework that shifts the focus of machine learning from pattern recognition to experience-driven sequential decision-making. It promises to carry AI applications forward toward taking actions in the real world. While largely confined to academia over the past several decades, it is now seeing some practical, real-world successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas traditional machine learning has mostly focused on pattern mining,\n",
    "reinforcement learning shifts the focus to decision making, and is a technology that\n",

    "experience-driven sequential decision-making, but the methods have not found great\n",
    "success in practice, mainly owing to issues of representation and scaling. However,\n",

    "number of games against itself and applying reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robotics** is currently concerned with how to train a robot to interact with the world around it in generalizable and predictable ways, how to facilitate manipulation of objects in interactive environments, and how to interact with people. Advances in robotics will rely on commensurate advances to improve the reliability and generality of computer vision and other forms of machine perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computer vision** is currently the most prominent form of machine perception. It has been the sub-area of AI most transformed by the rise of deep learning. For the first time, computers are able to perform some vision tasks better than people. Muchcurrent research is focused on automatic image and video captioning.\n"
