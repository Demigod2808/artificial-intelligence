 ## The Imitation Game
>"Can machines think?"

- To define the meaning of the terms **machine** and **think**, Turing proposes a new form of the problem that can be described in terms of an imitation game.

- The game is played with three people:
    - A man (A)
    - A woman (B)
    - An interrogator (C)
- The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two.

- The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman.

- He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either **X is A and Y is B** or **X is B and Y is A**.

- The answers should be written, or better still, typewritten.

>What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?
